# Rocket Alert System with ESP8266

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a real-time rocket alert system using the ESP8266 module. When an alert is issued for a specific city, the system will notify the user in real-time.

## Module

**ESP8266**: A low-cost Wi-Fi module that can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. It allows for internet connectivity, making it ideal for projects that require real-time data fetching.

## Idea

In regions where rocket alerts are frequent, it's crucial for residents to be notified promptly. Traditional alert systems might be limited in reach, or residents might miss the notification. This system ensures that a clear and timely indication is provided as soon as an alert is issued for a specific city.

The ESP8266 fetches real-time data from the server and checks if there's an alert for the predefined city. If an alert exists, the system notifies the user.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Setup:

1. Connect the ESP8266 as per the schematics provided.
2. Ensure a stable power source for the ESP8266 module.

### Software Setup:

1. Install the Arduino IDE and necessary libraries for ESP8266.
2. Load the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
3. Update the Wi-Fi credentials and server details in the code.
4. Select the correct COM port and board (ESP8266) from the Tools menu in the Arduino IDE.
5. Upload the code to the ESP8266.

### Testing:

1. Once the code is uploaded, the ESP8266 will start fetching data from the server.
2. If an alert is issued for the predefined city, the system will notify the user.

### Customization:

1. Users can customize the city for which alerts are to be checked.

## Disclaimer and Responsibility
